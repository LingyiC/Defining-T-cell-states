# Defining-T-cell-states
1. Identify individual markers associated with response and lack of response. 
Method: See 'Differential expression analysis' part
Data: gene expression values of 6,350 CD8+ T cells (cell ID's found in Table S2)
Truth: Table S2

2. Survival analysis of TCF7+CD8+ in clinical outcome anti-PD-1 therapy
Method: See 'Survival analysis' part
Data: Table S3, including patients' survival data and immunofluorescence-generated ratios.
Truth: Kaplan-Meier log rank p = 0.03 (which can be found in the Results section context)
